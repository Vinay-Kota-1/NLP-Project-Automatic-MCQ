              "'THE BOY WHO LIVED Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people you’d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn’t hold with such nonsense. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn’t want Dudley mixing with a child like that. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn’t realize what he had seen — then he jerked his head around to look again. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at Page | 3 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling the cat. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day. He made several important telephone Page | 4 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling calls and shouted a bit more. The Potters, that’s right, that’s what I heard — ” “ — yes, their son, Harry — ” Mr. Dursley stopped dead. He didn’t blame her — if he’d had a sister like that ... but all the same, those people in cloaks ... Page | 5 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o’clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door. “ He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn’t approve of imagination. Page | 7 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. Instead he said, as casually as he could, “Their son — he’d be about Dudley’s age now, wouldn’t he?” “ Instead he was smiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. You’d think they’d be a bit more careful, but no — even the Muggles have noticed something’s going on. Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice. “ cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her Page | 14 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K. Rowling feet and pointing at number four. “ Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night. “ One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours’ time by Mrs. Dursley’s scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley. ... It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had a large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she’d ever owned. “ The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didn’t make them happen. Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn’t been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left “to hide that horrible scar.” Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses. The harder she tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn’t fit Harry. But all he’d tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his Page | 27 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors. He liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects. The Dursleys bought Dudley Page | 28 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house. The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over again. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn’t done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon’s car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the Dursleys were his only family. A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot, he was the leader. One day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Figg’s. As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which he carried everywhere, on the table. Page | 36 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling “Get the mail, Dudley,” said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper. “ He had no friends, no other relatives — he didn’t belong to the library, so he’d never even got rude notes asking for books back. Page | 38 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held it high out of his reach. Someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn’t received his first letter. Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making sure that Harry didn’t do exactly what he’d been trying to do.'"
